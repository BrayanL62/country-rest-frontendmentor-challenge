# Rest Countries API w/ color theme switcher 🇫🇷

### NEXT JS 🤓
I chose to use Next JS because this isn't my predilection language and I needed to develop my skill with this one.

### TAILWIND 😁
I chose to use Tailwind to configure my CSS because I wanted to discover another CSS framework other than Bootstrap or Bulma and I started from scratch with this one. I just discovered the beast so, my code will surely be more optimised in the futur.

###### I really liked doing this challenge, it pushed me to think differently and allowed me to work on my logic. I'm on my way to becoming a better developer thanks to this challenge. It's not perfect and there are definitely improvements to be made, but I'm very proud of what I've managed to accomplish as a junior developer. Thank you FrontEndMentor for providing this kind of challenge!
